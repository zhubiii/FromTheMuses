<p class="mx-5 p_font">This database, From The Muses, developed from the serendipitous partnership between an undergraduate computer science student in need of an internship and a former archaeologist turned Latin teacher with too many photos.<br/><br/>



Over the course of years traveling around the Mediterranean on excavations and adventures, combined with a yearlong research fellowship in Turkey, I have accumulated a large amount of photos from sites and museums filled with the artifacts of ancient Greek and Roman culture, many of which are harder to get to and not well published. Recognizing the limited access that many have to these images, the tendency for copyright limitations on images, and the lack of clean, well-designed website for such images, I have long wanted to create an online, searchable database of such photos. The ultimate goal was to create a space that was easy for teachers and students to navigate and explore images they could use in their own teaching and presentation, copy-right free. While the database needed to be searchable by culture, period, object type, etc, the priority was to create topical albums that capture the interconnectivity of different object types and themes across periods and between cultures. And ultimately, I wanted  the database to be open to all teachers, students, and amateur adventurers to add their own photos to, so that there was an ever-expanding amount of photos to draw from for inspiration.<br/><br/>



Enter Brian Zhu. Brian is an undergraduate computer science major at Lehigh University. Due to Covid-19 cancelling many in person opportunities for summer work and interning, Brian was at a loss for summer plans. A Lehigh University Professor put a call out on Facebook in search of ideas; Dr. Allison Mickel and I worked on the Bir Madhkur project in Jordan together in 2010 and have remained good friends. I responded with my proposal; emails were exchanged; Zooms took place, and we were off and running!<br/><br/>



Brian has developed this clean, user-friendly website for our database. As we continue to add photos and tweak the particulars, we are looking forward to bringing more and more of the public on board. This site could be an excellent resource for educators looking to develop online projects in their courses, either by having students work on identifying the missing information from objects, adding more to object descriptions, or even creating their own albums of interconnected material from their perspective. We are open to input, advice, and more photos! <br/><br/><hr>

<p class="mx-5 p_font">Dr. Ann Morgan received her PhD in Classics from The University of Texas at Austin in 2014. She has taught Latin, Roman Archaeology and other such courses at The College of William and Mary, University of Southern California, California State University-Dominguez Hills, and Trinity University. She currently teaches the upper levels of Latin at Parish Episcopal School in Dallas, where she also serves as the subject area coordinator for World Languages. During her graduate studies, she worked at the Saronic Harbors Archaeological Research Project, Ostia Synagogue Mapping Project, and the Bir Madhkur Project, as well as studying at the Research Center for Anatolian Civilizations (ANAMED) in Istanbul and serving as an independent researcher at Aphrodisias and Ephesos. Since graduating, Dr. Morgan has served as the registrar for the Omrit Settlement Excavations and Total Station Specialist for the Lechaio Harbor and Settlement Project. In 2017, she received her Master in Education, specializing in educational technology.
